You are working on rungs.

Understand what rungs is by reading the README.md

The spec for how rungs works is in @docs/SPEC.md.

You find your work in @docs/ISSUES.md
- The issues are ordered by priority. Bugs always take priority over features.
- During your development, you might find another bug or issue. Update the ISSUES.md IMMEDIATELY with a subagent.

After you complete your work, build and run the tests. Then commit and use rungs to create a PR.
