# Compact Mode Line Replacement Fix

## Summary
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: CLI output mixed verbose logging with compact progress indicators, causing visual inconsistency.

**Solution**: Implemented output mode awareness in StackManager with conditional logging that uses OperationTracker for compact mode and traditional logging for verbose mode.

**Key Changes**:
- Added output mode parameter to StackManager constructor
- Created `withOperation()` method for conditional logging
- Integrated OperationTracker for self-replacing progress lines
- Added output suppression in compact mode

**Result**: Clean, consistent compact output with proper line replacement functionality.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The rungs CLI has inconsistent output systems that create mixed verbose and compact output during stack manager operations:

1. **Dual Output Systems**: Stack manager uses traditional verbose logging (`startGroup`, `logProgress`, `logSuccess`) while the CLI layer uses the new `OperationTracker` for compact operations
2. **Line Replacement Conflicts**: The compact mode's self-replacing progress indicators get interrupted by verbose output from stack manager operations
3. **Mixed Visual Paradigms**: Users see both spinning progress indicators (compact) and traditional log lines (verbose) in the same command execution

### Affected Scenarios
- `rungs status --compact`: Shows mixed output during stack discovery
- `rungs stack --compact`: Progress tracking gets interrupted by verbose logging
- All compact mode operations that involve stack manager methods

```

## Solution Strategy

### 1. Output Mode Awareness
Make all stack manager operations aware of the current output mode and use appropriate logging methods:

- **Verbose Mode**: Continue using existing `startGroup`/`endGroup` pattern
- **Compact Mode**: Use `OperationTracker` for all sub-operations

### 2. Conditional Logging Abstraction
Create a unified logging interface in stack manager that switches between verbose and compact modes:

```typescript
interface StackLogger {
  startOperation(message: string, type: OperationType): string;
  updateOperation(id: string, message: string): void;
  completeOperation(id: string, message: string): void;
  failOperation(id: string, message: string, error?: string): void;
  logInfo(message: string): void;
}
```

### 3. Operation Tracker Integration
Replace all verbose logging calls in stack manager with operation tracker calls when in compact mode.

## Implementation Summary

The fix was implemented through these key changes:

1. **Stack Manager Output Mode Detection**: Added output mode parameter to StackManager constructor with default 'verbose' for backward compatibility.

2. **Conditional Logging Abstraction**: Created `withOperation()` method that switches between OperationTracker (compact) and traditional logging (verbose).

3. **CLI Integration**: Modified CLI to pass output mode to StackManager, removing redundant operation tracking.

4. **Output Suppression**: Added capability to suppress verbose logging in compact mode while preserving essential error messages.

## Verification

The fix has been successfully implemented and tested:

### Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Compact mode shows only self-replacing progress lines
- ✅ No mixed verbose/compact output in single command  
- ✅ All operations complete successfully in both modes
- ✅ Error messages remain visible and actionable
- ✅ Consistent visual paradigm within each output mode
- ✅ No performance degradation

### Key Testing Areas
- Status command compact output validation
- Output mode switching between verbose and compact
- Error scenarios in compact mode  
- Long-running operations with progress updates

This fix successfully addresses the core user experience issue while maintaining backward compatibility and system reliability.
