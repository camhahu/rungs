# Improve `rungs status` Output Format - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented improved status output with the following enhancements:
- Individual commit details shown for each PR (SHA + description)
- Clickable PR URLs in both compact and verbose modes
- Separate "New Commits (ready to push)" section for unstacked commits
- Removal of the incorrect overall commit count
- All tests passing (171 tests, 0 failures)

## Problem Statement

The original `rungs status` output lacked detail and was not user-friendly:
1. Did not show individual commits for each PR in the stack
2. Did not show unstacked local commits separately  
3. Showed misleading overall commit count (currently wrong)
4. Did not include clickable PR links for easy access
5. Did not display commit SHAs and descriptions for better context

## Implementation

### Key Changes Made
- Updated `GitManager` with `getCommitsForBranch()` and `getUnstakedCommits()` methods
- Enhanced `StackManager` to populate commit data for each PR
- Improved output formatting in both compact and verbose modes
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

```
