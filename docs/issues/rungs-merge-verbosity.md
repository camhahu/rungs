# Rungs Merge Verbosity Issue - COMPLETED

## Summary
Fixed `rungs merge` command to respect output mode configuration. The command now uses compact mode by default (with OperationTracker) and only shows verbose output when --verbose flag is provided, making it consistent with other commands.

## Issue Description
The `rungs merge` command was always using verbose output with section headers regardless of the global output mode setting, unlike other commands that properly respect compact/verbose mode configuration.

## Solution Implemented
- Modified `handleMerge` function in `/Users/camhahu/Documents/Projects/rungs/src/cli.ts` to check `output.getOutputMode()`
- Added OperationTracker pattern for compact mode (default behavior)
- Preserved verbose mode functionality when --verbose flag is used
- Added comprehensive test coverage with 22 new tests

## Verification
- All 235 tests pass including new merge output mode tests
- Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- Manual testing confirms proper compact/verbose mode behavior
- Consistent user experience across all CLI commands
